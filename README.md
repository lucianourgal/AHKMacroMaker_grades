# AHKMacroMaker_old
 This software was developed around 2014 using Java and has very specific use. However, its a good example.<br><br>
 
# Input Data
Its input is based on a sheet containg students grades.

# Goal
The main goal was to insert the students grades into the system without doing that manually (and with access restricted to the system front end only).<br>
The input fields positions were mapped to pixels so we known where we should click to set each value.

# Output data
Using the student grades and the page text inputs locations, this code creates Auto Hotkey scripts (right into the sw window) so the student grades insertion into the system is done automatically.
